<p>I interned at Bloomberg LP this past summer. During the summer internship, I participated in two rotations with Equity and Fixed Income Analytics and Core Sales teams, providing financial technology solutions and data to Tier-1 UK investment banks.</p>
<p>This upcoming summer, I will be joining Bank of America Merrill Lynchâ€™s Global Investment Banking Group in the generalist pool, contributing to live deals and pitches.</p>
